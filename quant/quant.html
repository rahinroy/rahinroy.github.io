				Quantum Security LLC, founded in 2019 is a startup with a focus on Quantum Computing and Cyber Security solutions. With significant funding from US, China, Europe and many other governments, research in Quantum Computing technology has picked up pace in recent years. Technology giants like IBM, Google, Microsoft, Intel as well as new startups such as D-Wave, Rigetti and 1Qubit among many other startups are making significant progress. While Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum computers (NISQ) Computers with 5 to 50 Qubits and 2000 qubit annealing computers are a reality now, race to build more powerful and error correcting quantum computers is full on. When the Universal Quantum Computer is realized in the near future, experts believe that it will solve many of today's np-hard problems. Many of these have been a mystery to mankind, not solved with even the most powerful supercomputers of this age. These will bring many breakthrough solutions in areas like chemistry, material science, space science, pharmaceutical research, logistics, cyber security, finance, and other areas. They will enable new methods for machine learning, artificial intelligence, optimization and simulation. Quantum computers will even challenge and change the way we securely communicate information. It certainly sounds like a fantastic and exciting next frontier in computing!
